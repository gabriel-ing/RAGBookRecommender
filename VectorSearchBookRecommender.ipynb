Offering timely and respected research, this edition includes a thorough examination of drug trafficking, new sections on emerging organized crime groups, updated case studies, more coverage international groups, updated statistics, graphics and more! Presents a broad view of organized crime that incorporates more than just ethnically- driven, pop-culture stereotypes. Incorporates two parallel themes—organized crime consists of many different groups and corrupt individuals in public office, business etc., contribute to the continuation of the problem. Uses thematic questions (What is organized crime? Is there really a Mafia? Is terrorism organized crime? Do political machines still exist?) to promote higher-order thinking skills and a critical examination of the topic. Synthesizes volumes of historical data and archives to present the most salient aspects of the organized crime problem.
